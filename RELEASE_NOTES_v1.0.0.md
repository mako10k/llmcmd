# llmcmd v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview
First stable release of llmcmd - A secure command-line tool that enables Large Language Models to execute text processing tasks using the OpenAI ChatCompletion API.

## 🎉 New Features

### Core Functionality
- **Secure LLM Integration**: OpenAI ChatCompletion API with built-in function calling
- **File Processing**: Read from files or stdin, write to files or stdout
- **Built-in Commands**: Text processing without external command execution
- **Configurable**: Support for configuration files and environment variables

### Tool System (Phase 1 Enhancements)
- **Enhanced read tool**: Support for line-based reading (`lines` parameter)
- **Enhanced write tool**: Optional newline control (`newline` parameter)
- **New fstat tool**: File statistics and metadata information
- **Improved pipe tool**: Secure built-in command execution
- **exit tool**: Clean program termination

### Built-in Commands
- `cat`: Data copying and concatenation
- `grep`: Pattern matching with basic regex support
- `sed`: Text substitution (basic functionality)
- `head`/`tail`: Line-based filtering
- `sort`: Alphabetical sorting
- `wc`: Counting (lines, words, characters)
- `tr`: Character translation

## 🔧 System Optimizations

### Performance Improvements
- **Optimized System Prompt**: Streamlined for efficiency and clarity
- **Split Message Architecture**: Improved LLM instruction processing
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better debugging and user feedback

### Security Features
- **No External Commands**: All operations use built-in functions only
- **File Access Control**: Limited to specified input/output files
- **API Rate Limiting**: Maximum 50 calls per session with 300s timeout
- **Memory Limits**: 4KB read buffer, 10MB file size limits

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed LLM Instruction Confusion**: Resolved issue where LLM would output internal instructions instead of processing input data
- **Message Context Clarification**: Added clear separation between technical instructions and user requests

## 📊 Testing
- **Unit Test Coverage**: 80%+ coverage across core modules
- **Integration Tests**: API and tool interaction validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Real-world scenario testing
- **All Tests Passing**: Comprehensive test suite validation

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Text Processing
```bash
echo "Hello World" | llmcmd "Convert to uppercase"
```

### File Processing
```bash
llmcmd "Count the lines in this file" < input.txt > output.txt
```

### Complex Operations
```bash
echo -e "apple\nbanana\ncherry" | llmcmd "Sort alphabetically and number each line"
```

## 📋 System Requirements
- **Go**: 1.21 or higher for building from source
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for LLM functionality
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, Windows

## 📁 Installation
1. Download the binary: `llmcmd-v1.0.0`
2. Set executable permissions: `chmod +x llmcmd-v1.0.0`
3. Configure OpenAI API key in environment or config file
4. Run: `./llmcmd-v1.0.0 "your instruction here"`

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
- **Phase 2**: Extended OpenAI integration features
- **Phase 3**: Additional tool implementations
- **Phase 4**: More built-in commands
- **Phase 5**: Performance optimizations and advanced features

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Built with security and efficiency as core principles, following Go best practices and OpenAI API guidelines.
